## Predicting Student Performance on Final Exams

For details you may refer to the [Notebook]() for code or the [PDF]() for project presentation.

**Machine learning pipeline** that performs column transformation, feature selection and model training with the objective to classify students as either likely to fail on final exam or not. Several models were considered to compare the performance on the test set. The project features data transformation (multiple table joins), exploratory data analysis, explanatory analysis of XGBoost model predictions and error (false negatives) analysis. **
