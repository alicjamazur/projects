## Demo apps and projects
You will find here some demo applications and projects I created while getting to know data science and cloud computing concepts.

  + [Object Detection Application](https://github.com/molly-moon/projects/tree/master/object_detection)

    Serverless application that uses a deep learning model YOLOv2 to detect objects on uploaded images.

    The app is a single page website that accepts an input image for back-end serverless processing with AWS Lambda. It responds with the provided input image that has been marked with bouding boxes which represent detected objects. Each bounding box features a label that classifies the detected object.
