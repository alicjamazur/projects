# Demo apps and projects
<p> You will find here some demo applications and projects I created while getting to know data science and cloud computing concepts. </p>

<ul>

  <li>
  <a href="https://github.com/molly-moon/projects/tree/master/object_detection">Object Detection Application</a>
  <p>
		Serverless application that uses a deep learning model YOLOv2 to detect objects on uploaded images. The inference code was written by me during 
		the Deep Learning Specialization course, created by <i>deeplearning.ai</i>. When creating this demo I was inspired by an open-source project 
		<i>Serverless Stack</i> by Anomaly Innovations. The API and website are both hosted on AWS. The front-end is a single page app build on top of 
		<i>Create React App</i> project, developed by Facebook.
