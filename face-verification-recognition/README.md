### Face verification and recognition with Inception model

This project implements Inception algorithm for face verification and face recognition. 

+ Face verification part accepts user input that to claim their identity and asseses whether the claimed identity is    true or not. Model compared the input image with the ground truth records stored in a database. Test 1 was conveyed so that user input represented a true claimed identity, while during Test 2 a false claimed identity was introduced.

+ Face recognition part accepts a user's face image and returns its best prediction for their identity, based on a ground truth records stored in a database.
