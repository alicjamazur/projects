### Hand gesture classification with ResNet50

The project allows to identify a number shown with hand gesture captured on images. It uses a ResNet deep learning model and leverages pre-trained weights. The model accepts an input image and returns a probability vector with 6 elements, corresponding to numbers 0-5.
